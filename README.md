# Calibrated uncertainty
Playing around with ideas from a few papers:

[1] [Simple and Scalable Predictive Uncertainty Estimation using Deep Ensembles](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.01474.pdf)

[2] [Reliable Uncertainty Estimates in Deep Neural Networks using Noise Contrastive Priors](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.09289v2.pdf)
